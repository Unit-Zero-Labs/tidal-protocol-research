**Analysis Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Pool Configuration:** MOET:YT Pools with 95% Concentrated Liquidity  
**Test Methodology:** Yield Token Pool Capacity Analysis Script

# Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the scaling performance of MOET:YT Uniswap V3 pools across different sizes, from $250,000 to $2,500,000 per side (representing $500,000 to $5,000,000 total liquidity). The study examines how concentrated liquidity capacity scales with pool size, providing essential data for protocol sizing and risk management decisions.

## Key Findings

| Pool Size (Per Side) | Total Liquidity | Max Safe Trade | Pool Utilization | Efficiency |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **$250,000** | $500,000 | $225,000 | 90.0% | 90.0% |
| **$500,000** | $1,000,000 | $400,000 | 80.0% | 80.0% |
| **$1,000,000** | $2,000,000 | $900,000 | 90.0% | 90.0% |
| **$2,500,000** | $5,000,000 | $2,000,000 | 80.0% | 80.0% |

**Key Insight:** Pool capacity scales with size, maintaining 80-90% utilization efficiency across all tested configurations.

# Pool Architecture and Configuration

## Concentrated Liquidity Design

All pools implement Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity mechanism with consistent specifications:

- **Concentration Level:** 95% liquidity within Â±1% of 1:1 peg
- **Tick Spacing:** 10 (0.01% price granularity)
- **Fee Tier:** 0.05% (500 basis points for stable pairs)

## Liquidity Distribution

Each pool maintains three discrete liquidity positions:

1. **Primary Range:** [-100, +100] ticks (95% of liquidity)
2. **Lower Backup:** [-1000, -100] ticks (2.5% of liquidity)  
3. **Upper Backup:** [+100, +1000] ticks (2.5% of liquidity)

This architecture ensures maximum capital efficiency while providing fallback liquidity for extreme price movements.

# Pool Scaling Analysis

## Test Methodology

Pool scaling testing evaluates capacity across different pool sizes using identical swap size ranges. Each pool is tested with the same 22 swap sizes from $70,000 to $2,000,000 to ensure consistent comparison.
