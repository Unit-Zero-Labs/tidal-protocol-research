**Analysis Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Test Scenario:** 120 High Tide Agents ($12M TVL) with Pool Rebalancing & 1-Hour Arbitrage Delay  
**Market Stress:** 50% BTC Price Decline Over 36 Hours  
**Capital Efficiency:** 24:1 TVL-to-Pool Ratio

## Executive Summary

This study demonstrates High Tide Protocol's exceptional capital efficiency under realistic market constraints. With 120 agents representing $12 million in total value locked (TVL), the system achieved a remarkable **24:1 capital efficiency ratio** against a $500,000 MOET:YT liquidity pool, even with a 1-hour arbitrage delay that simulates real-world settlement constraints.

### Key Findings

- **Perfect Survival Rate:** 100% of agents survived a 50% BTC decline
- **Extreme Capital Efficiency:** $12M TVL supported by $500K pool (24:1 ratio)
- **Arbitrage Delay Resilience:** System maintained perfect performance despite 1-hour external settlement delays
- **Pool Utilization:** Peak single rebalance reached $476,556 (95.3% of pool capacity)
- **Cost Efficiency:** Average slippage of only $2.09 per rebalance across 12,240 events

## Test Configuration

### Market Scenario
- **Duration:** 36 hours (2,160 minutes)
- **BTC Price Movement:** Decline from $100,000 to $50,000 (-50%)
- **Price Pattern:** Gradual decline with realistic volatility
- **Stress Level:** Extreme bearish scenario

### Agent Configuration
- **Total Agents:** 120 High Tide users
- **Individual Capital:** $100,000 per agent
- **Total TVL:** $12,000,000
- **Health Factor Profile:**
  - Initial HF: 1.25
  - Rebalancing Trigger: 1.025
  - Target HF: 1.04

### Pool Rebalancer Configuration
- **Total Pool Liquidity:** $500,000 (all MOET initially)
- **ALM Rebalancer:** 12-hour intervals (scheduled maintenance)
- **Algo Rebalancer:** 50 basis point deviation threshold
- **Arbitrage Delay:** 1 hour (simulates real-world settlement times)
- **Capital Efficiency Ratio:** 24:1 (TVL:Pool)

### Arbitrage Delay Mechanism
The arbitrage delay feature introduces realistic constraints by preventing immediate external YT token sales after pool rebalancing. This creates temporary capital lock-up, testing the system's resilience under liquidity pressure.

- **Delay Period:** 1 hour (auto-converted for simulation time scale)
- **Effect:** YT tokens accumulate in rebalancer inventory during delay
- **Purpose:** Simulate real-world arbitrage settlement times and capital constraints

## Pool Rebalancer Analysis

### Rebalancing Event Timeline

The pool rebalancer system executed 8 total interventions over the 36-hour period:

#### ALM Rebalancer Events (Scheduled Maintenance)
1. **Hour 12.0:** Minor adjustment ($10,853 trade, 1.4 bps deviation)
2. **Hour 24.0:** Significant intervention ($183,539 trade, 23.2 bps deviation)

#### Algo Rebalancer Events (Deviation-Triggered)
1. **Hour 15.5:** $434,817 trade (55.1 bps deviation)
2. **Hour 18.8:** $409,541 trade (51.9 bps deviation)  
3. **Hour 22.5:** $476,556 trade (60.4 bps deviation) - **Peak utilization**
4. **Hour 27.3:** $431,909 trade (54.7 bps deviation)
5. **Hour 30.5:** $403,230 trade (51.1 bps deviation)
6. **Hour 34.0:** $445,594 trade (56.5 bps deviation)

### Arbitrage Delay Impact Analysis

The most significant finding occurred during Event 5 (ALM Rebalancer at Hour 24.0), where the arbitrage delay mechanism revealed its impact:

#### Without Delay (Previous Tests):
- ALM MOET Balance: Remained ~$500,000 throughout
- YT Holdings: Always $0 (immediate external sales)

#### With 1-Hour Delay (This Test):
- **ALM MOET Balance:** Dropped from $499,998 â†’ $316,459
- **YT Holdings:** Accumulated $183,802 in pending sales
- **Capital Lock-up:** 37% reduction in available MOET liquidity
- **System Response:** Continued perfect operation despite constraint

This demonstrates the system's remarkable resilience - even with 37% capital reduction, the pool rebalancer maintained perfect price accuracy and supported the full $12M TVL.

### Pool Utilization Metrics

| Rebalance Event | Amount ($) | Pool Utilization (%) | Deviation (bps) |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Hour 15.5 | 434,817 | 87.0% | 55.1 |
| Hour 18.8 | 409,541 | 81.9% | 51.9 |
| **Hour 22.5** | **476,556** | **95.3%** | **60.4** |
| Hour 27.3 | 431,909 | 86.4% | 54.7 |
| Hour 30.5 | 403,230 | 80.6% | 51.1 |
| Hour 34.0 | 445,594 | 89.1% | 56.5 |

The peak utilization of 95.3% demonstrates we approached the theoretical limit of the $500K pool while maintaining perfect system stability.
