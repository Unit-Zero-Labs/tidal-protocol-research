**Analysis Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Pool Configuration:** $250,000:$250,000 MOET:YT with 95% Concentrated Liquidity  
**Test Methodology:** Rebalance Liquidity Test Script

# Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the swap efficiency and capacity limits of a $250,000:$250,000 MOET:YT Uniswap V3 pool with 95% concentrated liquidity around the 1:1 peg. The study examines two critical scenarios: single large swaps and consecutive small rebalances, providing essential data for risk management and trading strategy optimization.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Single Swaps | Consecutive Rebalances | Analysis |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|----------|
| **Maximum Safe Capacity** | $225,000 | $240,000 | Concentrated Liquidity can handle roughly $238,000 |
| **Pool Utilization at Limit** | 90% | 96% | Near-complete liquidity utilization before range break |
| **Range Breaking Threshold** | $250,000 | 120 rebalances | Clear capacity boundaries identified |
| **Success Rate** | 95.7% | 100% (until break) | High reliability within capacity limits |

# Pool Architecture and Configuration

## Concentrated Liquidity Design

The analyzed pool implements Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity mechanism with the following specifications:

- **Total Pool Value:** $500,000 ($250,000 each side)
- **Concentration Level:** 95% liquidity within Â±1% of 1:1 peg
- **Tick Spacing:** 10 (0.01% price granularity)
- **Fee Tier:** 0.05% (500 basis points for stable pairs)
- **Range Break Threshold:** 5% price deviation from peg

## Liquidity Distribution

The pool maintains three discrete liquidity positions:

1. **Primary Range:** [-100, +100] ticks (95% of liquidity)
2. **Lower Backup:** [-1000, -100] ticks (2.5% of liquidity)  
3. **Upper Backup:** [+100, +1000] ticks (2.5% of liquidity)

This architecture ensures maximum capital efficiency while providing fallback liquidity for extreme price movements.

# Single Swap Capacity Analysis

## Test Methodology

Single swap testing evaluates the pool's ability to handle large, one-time transactions on fresh pool states. Each test uses a newly initialized pool to eliminate cumulative effects and measure pure swap capacity.

## Performance Results

\caption{Single Swap Capacity Analysis: Price Deviation, Slippage, Liquidity Utilization, and Success Rate}
\end{figure}

### Capacity Limits

- **Maximum Safe Swap:** $225,000 (90% pool utilization)
- **Range Breaking Point:** $250,000 (100% pool utilization)
- **Price Deviation at Limit:** 5.2% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- **Slippage at Limit:** 4.8% (significant cost impact)

### Efficiency Characteristics

| Swap Size | Price Deviation | Slippage | Liquidity Utilization | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| $100,000 | 0.4% | 0.2% | 40% | Safe |
| $150,000 | 0.8% | 0.6% | 60% | Safe |
| $200,000 | 1.2% | 1.1% | 80% | Safe |
| $225,000 | 2.1% | 2.3% | 90% | Safe (Max) |
| $250,000 | 5.2% | 4.8% | 100% | Range Broken |

### Key Observations

1. **Linear Performance:** Price deviation and slippage increase linearly up to $200,000
2. **Exponential Degradation:** Performance degrades rapidly beyond 80% utilization
3. **Clear Breaking Point:** $250,000 represents absolute capacity limit
4. **High Success Rate:** 95.7% of tested swap sizes remain within safe parameters

# Consecutive Rebalance Analysis

## Test Methodology

Consecutive rebalance testing simulates sustained trading activity with persistent pool state. Each $2,000 rebalance permanently modifies the pool's liquidity distribution, testing cumulative effects over time.

## Performance Results

\caption{Consecutive Rebalance Analysis: Price Evolution, Slippage Patterns, Volume Accumulation, and Liquidity Depletion}
\end{figure}

### Capacity and Timing

- **Total Rebalances Executed:** 120
- **Cumulative Volume Processed:** $240,000
- **Range Breaking Point:** Rebalance #120
- **Final Price Deviation:** 10.52%

### Performance Progression

| Rebalance Range | Price Deviation | Slippage | Active Liquidity | Status |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|------------------|--------|
| 1-50 | 0.08% - 0.42% | 0.13% - 0.46% | $47.4M | Stable |
| 51-100 | 0.42% - 0.84% | 0.46% - 0.88% | $47.4M | Stable |
| 101-115 | 0.84% - 0.93% | 0.88% - 0.96% | $47.4M | Stable |
| 116-119 | 0.93% - 0.99% | 0.96% - 1.02% | $47.4M | Stable |
| 120 | 10.52% | 30.2% | $0 | Range Broken |

### Key Observations

1. **Exceptional Stability:** Pool maintains stability through 119 consecutive rebalances
2. **Abrupt Breaking Point:** Range breaks suddenly at rebalance #120
3. **Complete Liquidity Exhaustion:** Active liquidity drops to $0 at breaking point

## Liquidity Utilization Patterns

The analysis reveals distinct utilization patterns:

1. **Linear Phase (0-80% utilization):** Predictable performance with minimal slippage
2. **Degradation Phase (80-95% utilization):** Increasing slippage and price deviation
3. **Critical Phase (95-100% utilization):** Rapid performance degradation
4. **Breaking Point (100% utilization):** Complete range failure

# Risk Management Implications

## Capacity Planning

Based on the analysis, the following capacity guidelines are recommended:

- **Conservative Trading:** Maximum $180,000 per transaction (72% utilization)
- **Standard Trading:** Maximum $200,000 per transaction (80% utilization)  
- **Aggressive Trading:** Maximum $225,000 per transaction (90% utilization)
- **Emergency Only:** Up to $240,000 total cumulative volume

## Monitoring Thresholds

| Threshold Level | Price Deviation | Action Required |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Green Zone** | 0-1% | Normal operations |
| **Yellow Zone** | 1-3% | Monitor closely, consider reducing trade sizes |
| **Orange Zone** | 3-5% | Reduce trade sizes, prepare for range break |
| **Red Zone** | >5% | Range broken, liquidity exhausted |

## Slippage Management

- **Target Slippage:** <1% for optimal cost efficiency
- **Acceptable Slippage:** 1-2% for standard operations
- **High Slippage:** 2-5% requires careful consideration
