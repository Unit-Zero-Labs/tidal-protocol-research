Fix Simulation Issues Script

This script addresses the issues found in the ecosystem growth simulation:
1. Arbitrage time-series chart showing blank data
2. Ecosystem growth capped at 300 agents preventing $150M target
3. Missing redeemer fees (due to advanced MOET system not being fully enabled)
4. Missing bond auction charts (functionality exists but not being called)

The fixes have been applied to the main simulation files.
