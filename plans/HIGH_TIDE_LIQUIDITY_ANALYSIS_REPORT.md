# High Tide Protocol Liquidity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the High Tide Protocol's performance across 16 different liquidity pool configurations. The analysis demonstrates how varying liquidity conditions impact rebalancing costs, agent survival rates, and overall protocol efficiency during market stress scenarios.

**Key Finding**: The optimal configuration is **$250k MOET:BTC + $2M MOET:YT**, achieving the lowest average rebalancing cost per agent while maintaining high survival rates.

## 1. Introduction: Testing Different Liquidity Conditions for the High Tide Protocol

The High Tide Protocol represents an innovative approach to decentralized lending that combines the collateralized borrowing mechanics of Tidal Protocol with active position management through yield token strategies. Unlike traditional lending protocols that rely on passive liquidation mechanisms, High Tide employs proactive rebalancing to protect user positions during market downturns.

This analysis examines how different liquidity pool configurations affect the protocol's ability to execute these rebalancing strategies efficiently, with particular focus on:

- **Rebalancing Cost Optimization**: Minimizing slippage and trading fees during position adjustments
- **Agent Survival Rates**: Maintaining healthy borrowing positions through market stress
- **Protocol Efficiency**: Maximizing capital utilization while preserving system stability

The study tests 16 distinct liquidity configurations to identify optimal pool sizing strategies for the High Tide Protocol.

## 2. Technical Specification of High Tide Protocol

### 2.1 Foundation: Tidal Protocol

High Tide is built on top of Tidal Protocol, a simulated lending platform that enables users to:

1. **Supply Collateral**: Deposit Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral
2. **Borrow Stablecoins**: Borrow MOET stablecoins against their collateral
3. **Active Management**: Maintain healthy borrowing positions through automated rebalancing

Tidal Protocol employs a **kinked interest rate model** where borrowing rates increase significantly when pool utilization exceeds 80%, creating economic incentives for active position management.

### 2.2 High Tide Enhancement: Yield Token Strategy

High Tide extends Tidal Protocol by introducing an active yield generation strategy:

1. **Automatic Yield Token Purchase**: Borrowed MOET is immediately converted to yield-bearing tokens earning 10% APR
2. **Continuous Yield Accrual**: Yield tokens compound interest every minute throughout the simulation
3. **Health Factor Monitoring**: System continuously tracks each agent's health factor (collateral value / debt value)
4. **Active Rebalancing**: When health factor drops below maintenance threshold, yield tokens are automatically sold to repay debt
5. **Liquidation as Last Resort**: Traditional liquidation only occurs if yield token sales are insufficient

### 2.3 Risk Profile Distribution

Agents are categorized into three risk profiles based on their initial health factors:

- **Conservative Agents (30%)**: Health Factor 2.1-2.4, Maintenance Threshold 2.0-2.2
- **Moderate Agents (40%)**: Health Factor 1.5-1.8, Maintenance Threshold 1.3-1.75  
- **Aggressive Agents (30%)**: Health Factor 1.3-1.5, Maintenance Threshold 1.25-1.3

This distribution reflects real-world user behavior patterns and provides comprehensive testing across different risk tolerances.

## 4. Simulation Parameters

### 4.1 Market Stress Scenario: BTC Price Decline

The simulation implements a realistic market stress scenario based on historical volatility patterns:

- **Initial BTC Price**: $100,000
- **Target Decline Range**: 15-25% (final price $75,000-$85,000)
- **Duration**: 60+ minutes with gradual decline
- **Volatility Pattern**: Based on 2025 historical data (-0.40% to -0.54% per minute)
- **Maximum Decline Rate**: -0.95% per minute (5% probability for extreme events)

This scenario tests the protocol's resilience during realistic market stress conditions.

### 4.2 Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity Setup

- **Remaining Liquidity**: Distributed across outer bins for price discovery
- **Fee Tier**: 0.3% trading fee

#### MOET:Yield Token Pool Configuration  
- **Concentration**: 95% of liquidity in a single bin at the exact peg (1.0 MOET per Yield Token)

## 5. Simulation Results Summary

### 5.1 Best Configuration: $500k MOET:BTC + $1M MOET:YT

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Average Cost per Agent**: Low rebalancing costs with sustainable liquidity
- **Agent Count**: Supports 40+ agents without liquidity exhaustion
- **Survival Rate**: High survival rate with consistent rebalancing performance
- **Pool Utilization**: Maintains healthy utilization throughout simulation

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Sustainable External Liquidity**: $500k MOET:BTC provides $400k concentrated liquidity (80% in peg bin)
2. **Efficient Internal Liquidity**: $1M MOET:YT ensures minimal slippage for rebalancing operations
3. **Capital Efficiency**: $1.5M total liquidity (33% less than original "best" configuration)
4. **Long-term Viability**: Concentrated liquidity can handle 80+ trades before exhaustion

**Critical Insight**: The original "best" configuration ($250k MOET:BTC + $2M MOET:YT) showed lowest average costs but exhausted its concentrated liquidity by 30 minutes, leading to poor performance for later rebalancing events. The revised configuration maintains consistent performance throughout the simulation.

### 5.2 Worst Configuration: $250k MOET:BTC + $250k MOET:YT

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Average Cost per Agent**: Highest among all configurations
- **Agent Count**: 36 agents (limited by liquidity constraints)
- **Survival Rate**: Lower due to higher rebalancing costs
- **Pool Utilization**: Both pools operating near capacity limits

**Key Disadvantages:**
1. **Limited External Liquidity**: $250k MOET:BTC creates high slippage for external trades
2. **Constrained Internal Liquidity**: $250k MOET:YT insufficient for efficient rebalancing
3. **High Costs**: Frequent rebalancing with high slippage increases overall costs
4. **Capacity Limits**: Configuration cannot support larger agent volumes

### 5.3 Key Insights from Analysis

1. **Internal Pool Size Critical**: Larger MOET:YT pools significantly reduce rebalancing costs
2. **External Pool Optimization**: MOET:BTC pools can be smaller while maintaining efficiency
3. **Asymmetric Configuration**: Optimal setup favors larger internal pools over external pools
4. **Cost-Performance Trade-off**: Higher total liquidity generally correlates with better agent outcomes

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 7.1 Optimal Configuration Strategy

The analysis demonstrates that the High Tide Protocol performs optimally with a **minimum viable liquidity configuration**:

- **MOET:BTC Pool**: $500k (provides $400k concentrated liquidity for sustainable trading)
- **MOET:YT Pool**: $1M (ensures efficient internal rebalancing operations)

This configuration achieves low rebalancing costs while maintaining sustainable liquidity throughout the simulation, avoiding the liquidity exhaustion issues found in smaller pool configurations.

### 7.2 Implementation Recommendations

1. **Minimum Viable Liquidity**: Use $500k MOET:BTC pools to avoid concentrated liquidity exhaustion
2. **Balanced Internal Liquidity**: $1M MOET:YT pools provide efficient rebalancing without over-allocation
3. **Monitor Utilization**: Track concentration utilization to identify when scaling is needed
4. **Risk Management**: Maintain sufficient liquidity buffers for extreme market conditions
5. **Capital Efficiency**: Focus on sustainable configurations rather than minimum cost configurations

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

1. **Dynamic Liquidity Management**: Implement automated liquidity rebalancing between pools
2. **Multi-Asset Analysis**: Extend analysis to include ETH and other collateral types
3. **Real-Time Optimization**: Develop algorithms for real-time liquidity allocation
4. **Stress Testing**: Conduct analysis under more extreme market conditions
