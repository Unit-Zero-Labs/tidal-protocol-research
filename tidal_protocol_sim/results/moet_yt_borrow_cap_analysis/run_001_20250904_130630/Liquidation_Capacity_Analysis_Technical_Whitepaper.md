# BTC:MOET Pool Liquidation Capacity Analysis
## Technical Whitepaper: Deposit Cap Optimization for Concentrated Liquidity DEX

**Analysis Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Protocol:** High Tide / Tidal Protocol  
**Focus:** Deposit Cap to DEX Liquidity Ratio Optimization  

---

## Executive Summary

This technical analysis evaluates the maximum deposit cap ratios that can be sustained by a $250K:$250K BTC:MOET concentrated liquidity pool under severe market stress scenarios. Through systematic testing of 15-agent liquidation cascades across three price shock severities (10%, 15%, 25% BTC declines), we determine the liquidation capacity limits before concentrated liquidity exhaustion renders further liquidations impossible.

**Key Findings:**
- The $500K total BTC:MOET pool can handle deposit cap ratios up to **5:1** ($2.5M deposits) without liquidity exhaustion
- Maximum concentration utilization reaches **25.7%** under worst-case scenarios (5:1 ratio, 25% shock)
- **100% liquidation success rate** achieved across all tested configurations
- Liquidation volumes scale linearly with deposit cap ratios while maintaining efficiency

**Recommendation:** Current pool configuration is **over-capitalized** for tested scenarios. Higher deposit cap ratios (6:1+) or larger shock scenarios (30%+) should be tested to identify actual breaking points.

## 1. Introduction and Research Objectives

### 1.1 Protocol Context

High Tide Protocol represents an automated yield aggregation layer built atop the Tidal Protocol lending engine. Unlike traditional lending protocols that rely on forced liquidations as the primary risk management mechanism, Tidal Protocol implements **active position management** through automated rebalancing operations that proactively defend user health factors during market downturns.

The protocol architecture consists of two primary liquidity pools:
1. **BTC:MOET Pool** - External liquidation pool for emergency debt resolution
2. **MOET:Yield Token Pool** - Internal rebalancing pool for position maintenance

### 1.2 Research Question

**Primary Objective:** Determine the maximum deposit cap ratio (total deposits : DEX liquidity) that can be sustained by the BTC:MOET liquidation pool under severe market stress without exhausting concentrated liquidity.

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Quantify concentration utilization patterns across different stress scenarios
- Evaluate liquidation slippage costs and efficiency metrics
- Establish risk-capacity trade-offs for deposit cap configuration

### 1.3 Critical Assumptions

- **Pool Configuration:** $250K BTC : $250K MOET with 80% concentration at peg
- **Agent Behavior:** No rebalancing mechanisms active (pure liquidation testing)
- **Market Conditions:** Single-epoch price shocks simulating extreme market stress
- **Liquidation Logic:** Aave-style partial liquidations targeting 1.1 health factor restoration

## 2. Technical Methodology

### 2.1 Simulation Architecture

The analysis employs a discrete-event Monte Carlo simulation framework with the following components:

#### 2.1.1 Agent Configuration
- **Agent Count:** 15 agents per scenario (fixed for consistency)
- **Health Factor Distribution:** Fixed progression from 1.1 to 1.8 in 0.05 increments
- **Collateral Scaling:** Equal distribution of total deposit capacity across agents

#### 2.1.2 Deposit Cap Ratio Testing
Five deposit cap ratios tested against the baseline $500K total pool:
- **1:1 Ratio:** $500K deposits vs $500K pool liquidity
- **2:1 Ratio:** $1M deposits vs $500K pool liquidity  
- **3:1 Ratio:** $1.5M deposits vs $500K pool liquidity
- **4:1 Ratio:** $2M deposits vs $500K pool liquidity
- **5:1 Ratio:** $2.5M deposits vs $500K pool liquidity

#### 2.1.3 Price Shock Scenarios
Three single-epoch BTC price decline scenarios:
- **Moderate Shock:** 10% BTC price decline ($100K → $90K)
- **Significant Shock:** 15% BTC price decline ($100K → $85K)
- **Severe Shock:** 25% BTC price decline ($100K → $75K)

## 3. Mathematical Formulations

### 3.1 Health Factor Calculation

The health factor for each agent is calculated as:

```
HF = (Collateral_Value × Collateral_Factor) / Debt_Value

Where:
- Collateral_Value = BTC_Amount × Current_BTC_Price
- Collateral_Factor = 0.80 (80% collateral factor for BTC)
- Debt_Value = MOET_Borrowed × MOET_Price (assumed $1.00)
```

**Liquidation Trigger:** HF < 1.0

### 3.2 Liquidation Mathematics

When an agent's health factor falls below 1.0, partial liquidation is executed:

#### 3.2.1 Target Debt Calculation
```
Target_Debt = (Collateral_Value × Collateral_Factor) / Target_HF_After_Liquidation

Where:
- Target_HF_After_Liquidation = 1.1
- Debt_To_Liquidate = Current_Debt - Target_Debt
```

#### 3.2.2 Collateral Seizure Calculation
```
Collateral_To_Seize = (Debt_To_Liquidate / BTC_Price) × (1 + Liquidation_Bonus)

Where:
- Liquidation_Bonus = 0.05 (5% liquidation penalty)
```

### 3.3 Uniswap V3 Concentrated Liquidity Mathematics

#### 3.3.1 Concentration Distribution
The BTC:MOET pool implements discrete liquidity bins with 80% concentration at peg:

```
Total_Pool_Liquidity = $500K ($250K BTC + $250K MOET)
Concentrated_Liquidity = Total_Pool_Liquidity × 0.80 = $400K
Peripheral_Liquidity = Total_Pool_Liquidity × 0.20 = $100K
```

#### 3.3.2 Slippage Calculation
For BTC → MOET swaps during liquidation:

```
Slippage_Amount = Expected_MOET_Out - Actual_MOET_Out

Where:
- Expected_MOET_Out = BTC_Amount × Spot_Price × (1 - Fee_Tier)
- Actual_MOET_Out = Σ(Bin_Output) across consumed liquidity bins
- Fee_Tier = 0.003 (0.3% Uniswap V3 fee)
```

#### 3.3.3 Concentration Utilization Metric
```
Concentration_Utilization = (Cumulative_Liquidations / Total_Pool_Liquidity) × 100

Critical_Threshold = 100% (complete liquidity exhaustion)
```

## 4. Simulation Implementation

### 4.1 Agent Creation Algorithm

```python
def create_varied_agents_for_liquidation_test(num_agents: int, btc_price: float, 
                                            collateral_factor: float, deposit_cap_ratio: float):
    # Fixed health factors for consistent testing
    fixed_health_factors = [1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.55, 1.6, 1.65, 1.7, 1.75, 1.8]
    
    # Calculate collateral per agent based on deposit cap ratio
    total_deposit_capacity = 250_000 * 2 * deposit_cap_ratio
    collateral_per_agent = total_deposit_capacity / num_agents
    
    for i in range(num_agents):
        initial_hf = fixed_health_factors[i % len(fixed_health_factors)]
        collateral_value = collateral_per_agent
        effective_collateral = collateral_value * collateral_factor
        debt_value = effective_collateral / initial_hf
```

### 4.2 Liquidation Priority Algorithm

Agents requiring liquidation are processed in order of **highest debt amount first** to simulate realistic liquidation bot behavior:

```python
# Sort agents by liquidation priority (highest debt first)
agent_details.sort(key=lambda x: x["liquidation_priority"], reverse=True)
```

## 5. Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Liquidation Success Metrics

**Figure 1: Maximum Concentration Utilization by Deposit Cap Ratio**

![Max Concentration Chart](charts/max_concentration_utilization.png)

The analysis reveals that concentration utilization scales sub-linearly with deposit cap ratios:
- **1:1 Ratio:** 5.1% maximum utilization (25% shock)
- **2:1 Ratio:** 10.3% maximum utilization (25% shock)  
- **3:1 Ratio:** 15.4% maximum utilization (25% shock)
- **4:1 Ratio:** 20.6% maximum utilization (25% shock)
- **5:1 Ratio:** 25.7% maximum utilization (25% shock)

### 5.2 Liquidation Volume Analysis

**Figure 2: Enhanced Liquidation Volume Analysis**

![Stacked Liquidation Dollars](charts/enhanced_liquidation_dollars_stacked.png)

Total liquidation volumes demonstrate linear scaling with deposit cap ratios, confirming proper mathematical implementation. The 25% shock scenario consistently drives the highest liquidation volumes across all ratios.

### 5.3 Concentration Risk vs Capacity Trade-offs

**Figure 3: Concentration Risk Analysis** 

![Concentration Risk Analysis](charts/concentration_risk_analysis.png)

The dual-axis analysis reveals optimal efficiency at moderate deposit cap ratios (2:1 to 3:1), where liquidation capacity increases faster than concentration risk.

### 5.4 Slippage Cost Efficiency

**Figure 4: Enhanced Slippage vs Liquidations**

![Enhanced Slippage](charts/enhanced_slippage_vs_liquidations.png)

Slippage costs exhibit predictable patterns with higher deposit ratios showing increased costs per liquidation due to greater pool utilization.

### 5.5 Liquidation Volume Heatmap

**Figure 5: Enhanced Liquidation Heatmap**

![Enhanced Heatmap](charts/enhanced_liquidation_heatmap.png)

The heatmap visualization confirms that liquidation volumes scale predictably with both deposit cap ratios and shock severity, with the 5:1 ratio under 25% shock representing the maximum stress scenario tested.

## 7. Risk Assessment and Recommendations

### 7.1 Liquidity Buffer Analysis

Current results indicate substantial liquidity headroom:
- **Maximum utilization:** 25.7% under most severe tested conditions
- **Buffer remaining:** 74.3% concentration liquidity unused
- **Safety margin:** 4x current maximum utilization before exhaustion

### 7.2 Deposit Cap Recommendations

Based on simulation results:

1. **Conservative Approach:** 3:1 deposit cap ratio (15.4% max utilization)
2. **Moderate Approach:** 4:1 deposit cap ratio (20.6% max utilization)  
3. **Aggressive Approach:** 5:1 deposit cap ratio (25.7% max utilization)

### 7.3 Risk Considerations

**Concentration Risk Factors:**
- Higher deposit ratios increase liquidation volume concentration
- Slippage costs scale non-linearly with pool utilization
- Single large liquidation events may consume disproportionate liquidity

**Recommended Safeguards:**
- Dynamic deposit cap adjustment based on real-time pool utilization
- Emergency liquidity provision mechanisms for extreme scenarios
- Gradual liquidation implementation to spread impact across time

        self.btc_price = btc_price
        self.concentration = concentration
        self.peg_price = 0.00001  # 1 BTC = 100,000 MOET
```

## 11. Conclusions

The BTC:MOET pool liquidation capacity analysis demonstrates that the current $500K pool configuration provides substantial safety margins for deposit caps up to 5:1 ratios. Even under severe 25% BTC price shocks, concentration utilization remains below 26%, indicating significant unused liquidation capacity.

**Key Technical Insights:**
1. **Linear Scaling:** Liquidation volumes scale predictably with deposit cap ratios
2. **Sub-Linear Risk:** Concentration utilization increases more slowly than deposit capacity
3. **Shock Resilience:** Pool maintains liquidation capacity across all tested stress scenarios
4. **Efficiency Preservation:** Slippage costs remain manageable even at maximum tested ratios

**Strategic Implications:**
- Current pool sizing may be conservative relative to actual risk requirements
- Higher deposit caps could be sustained without compromising liquidation capacity
- Protocol can confidently support aggressive growth scenarios within tested parameters

This analysis provides quantitative foundation for deposit cap policy decisions while highlighting areas for future research to identify ultimate capacity limits.

## Appendix A: Detailed Mathematical Proofs

### A.1 Health Factor Derivation

For a leveraged position with collateral C and debt D:

```
HF = (C × CF) / D

Post-shock HF = (C × (1 - shock_rate) × CF) / D
              = HF₀ × (1 - shock_rate)

Where:
- HF₀ = initial health factor
- shock_rate = percentage price decline
- CF = collateral factor
```

### A.2 Liquidation Amount Optimization

To restore health factor to target value HF_target after liquidation:

```
(C - C_seized) × CF / (D - D_repaid) = HF_target

Solving for D_repaid:
D_repaid = D - (C - C_seized) × CF / HF_target

Where:
C_seized = (D_repaid / P_BTC) × (1 + liquidation_bonus)
```
