## 1. Research Objectives and Methodology

### 1.1 Comparative Analysis Framework

This study implements a controlled comparison between two fundamentally different approaches to managing leveraged positions under market stress:

**High Tide Protocol Approach:**
- **Automated Rebalancing:** Proactive yield token sales when health factor drops below target threshold
- **Position Preservation:** Maintains user positions through market volatility
- **Cost Structure:** Rebalancing costs + Uniswap V3 slippage + yield opportunity cost

**AAVE Protocol Approach:**
- **Passive Monitoring:** No intervention until health factor crosses 1.0 liquidation threshold
- **Liquidation-Based:** Reactive position closure when positions become unsafe
- **Cost Structure:** Liquidation penalties + collateral seizure + protocol fees

### 1.2 Experimental Design

**Health Factor Scenarios Tested:**
| Scenario | Initial HF Range | Target HF | Risk Profile |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Aggressive 1.01 | 1.20-1.30 | 1.010 | Aggressive |
| Moderate 1.025 | 1.30-1.40 | 1.025 | Aggressive |
| Conservative 1.05 | 1.40-1.50 | 1.050 | Moderate |
| Mixed 1.075 | 1.20-1.50 | 1.075 | Conservative |
| Balanced 1.1 | 1.25-1.45 | 1.100 | Conservative |


**Market Stress Parameters:**
- **BTC Price Decline:** $100,000 → $76,342 (23.66% decline)
- **Duration:** 60 minutes (sustained pressure)
- **Agent Population:** 15 agents per scenario
- **Monte Carlo Runs:** 5 per scenario for statistical significance

### 1.3 Pool Configuration and Economic Parameters

**High Tide Pool Infrastructure:**
- **MOET:BTC Liquidation Pool:** $250,000 each side (emergency liquidations)
- **MOET:Yield Token Pool:** $250,000 each side (90% concentration)
- **Yield Token APR:** 12.0% annual percentage rate

**AAVE Pool Infrastructure:**
- **MOET:BTC Liquidation Pool:** $250,000 each side (same as High Tide for fair comparison)
- **Liquidation Parameters:** 50% collateral seizure + 5% liquidation penalty

## 2. Mathematical Framework and Cost Models

### 2.1 High Tide Rebalancing Mathematics

**Health Factor Trigger Mechanism:**
```
Rebalancing_Triggered = Current_Health_Factor < Target_Health_Factor

Where:
Current_HF = (BTC_Collateral × BTC_Price × Collateral_Factor) / MOET_Debt
Target_HF = Predetermined threshold (1.01 - 1.1 tested range)
```

**Debt Reduction Calculation:**
```
Target_Debt = (Effective_Collateral_Value) / Initial_Health_Factor
Debt_Reduction_Required = Current_Debt - Target_Debt
Yield_Tokens_To_Sell = min(Debt_Reduction_Required, Available_Yield_Tokens)
```

**High Tide Cost Model:**
```
Total_HT_Cost = Yield_Opportunity_Cost + Uniswap_V3_Slippage + Trading_Fees

Where:
Yield_Opportunity_Cost = Yield_Tokens_Sold × (1 + Time_Remaining × Yield_Rate)
Uniswap_V3_Slippage = f(Amount, Pool_Liquidity, Concentration)
Trading_Fees = 0.3% of swap value
```

### 2.2 AAVE Liquidation Mathematics

**Liquidation Trigger Mechanism:**
```
Liquidation_Triggered = Current_Health_Factor ≤ 1.0

Liquidation cannot be prevented once triggered
```

**AAVE Liquidation Cost Model:**
```
Total_AAVE_Cost = Liquidation_Penalty + Collateral_Loss + Protocol_Fees

Where:
Liquidation_Penalty = 5% of liquidated debt
Collateral_Loss = (Debt_Liquidated / BTC_Price) × (1 + 0.05)
Protocol_Fees = Variable based on pool utilization
```
